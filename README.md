# PolyCore
Garmin Forerunner app for my core routine

### Instructions
Download the app from the [Garmin ConnectIQ Store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/f7e11632-e744-44ba-ba8a-5237cdc27091#0) and load it onto your watch!
Most of the exercises are intuitive, but some are a bit obscure, so I will be posting an instructional video soon!

### Compatability
Intended for Garmin Forerunners with a circular screen (230 and up, mostly), but works on ForeAthlete watches as well.

### Contributing
Feel free to fork and make any changes you like, or use this repo as a starting place to make something totally different!
